# 3x-pluss-1-graph
A very simple python script that creates a graph based on the rules of the infamous math problem 3x + 1.
1. Pick a (positive) number.
2. If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1, if it's even divide it by two.
3. Repeat until it hits a loop.

The conjecture asks whether repeating these two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1.
